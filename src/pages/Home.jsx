        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
         Iâ€™m an aspiring Frontend Developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, currently focusing on modern frameworks like React.

My learning approach is highly project-drivenâ€”I enjoy turning concepts into interactive web experiences. I pay attention to detail, whether it's styling a component for responsive layouts or optimizing performance using hooks like useEffect. Iâ€™m also exploring best practices in UI/UX to craft interfaces that feel intuitive and engaging.

I believe that great developers arenâ€™t bornâ€”theyâ€™re built through consistent practice and curiosity. Thatâ€™s the mindset I bring to every line of code.
